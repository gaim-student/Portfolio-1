This Portfolio 1 Assignment features the menu assignment that we previously did.

For this assignment, I added pictures by using two components. I also added another component that renders and returns a "Cart" component. This cart component pops up after a add to cart button is clicked. Another thing that I added is an alert that pops up when this button is clicked.

The menu also has different styling from the original assignment. The dinner and dessert menu headings are now light blue highlight with white lettering.
